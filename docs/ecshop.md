### Linepay Flow

1. Create order in our EC system, and get order_id, linepay_redirect_url from response.
2. Redirect to linepay_redirect_url, and pay in linepay.
3. After payment, linepay will redirect to LINEPAY_RETURN_HOST/checkout/linepay/confirm?transactionId=xxx&orderId=xxx
4. After front-end handle the redirect, it will need to call our EC system to confirm payment also update order status.
5. If payment is successful, it will return 200 status code, and front-end can redirect to success page.

Note:
    * Need to set LINEPAY_RETURN_HOST in .env file for frone-end redirection.
